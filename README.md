# newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter

The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the `external.metrics.k8s.io` API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries. 

During installation, a set of metrics can be configured to be available for `Horizontal Pod Autoscalers` to be used. Once deployed, the metrics values are fetched from the configured New Relic account using the NerdGraph API and the configured NRQL query.

The adapter uses the [Custom Metrics Adapter Server Boilerplate](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/custom-metrics-apiserver) as a base code to implement the external metric api server.


## Installation

This project has the `newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter` Helm Chart in [charts/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter/tree/main/charts/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter) and can also be installed through the `nri-bundle` chart in [newrelic helm charts repo](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts).

For further information regarding the installation refer to the official docs and to the README.md and the values.yaml of the [chart](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter/tree/main/charts/newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter).

## Getting Started

In order to start using the adapter, please start by [installing](#Installation) and configuring the adapter using the provided Helm Chart. After this, metrics will be available for consumption by `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` using the configured metric names. For further information regarding the usage of the adapter refer to the official [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/).

### Develop, Test and Run Locally

For the development process [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and [tilt](https://tilt.dev/) tools are used.

* [Install kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* [Install Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

#### Building

To build the image:
```sh
GOOS=linux make image
```

To build the binary:
```sh
GOOS=linux make build
```

#### Configure Tilt

If you want to use a `kind` cluster for testing, configure Tilt using the command below:

```sh
cat <<EOF > tilt_option.json
{
  "default_registry": "localhost:5000"
}
EOF
```

If you want to use existing Kubernetes cluster, create `tilt_option.json` file with content similar to below:

```json
{
  "default_registry": "quay.io/<your username>",
  "allowed_contexts": "<kubeconfig context to use>"
}
```

#### Creating kind cluster

If you want to use a local `kind` cluster for testing, create it with command below:

```sh
make kind-up
```

#### Run

If you use a `kind` cluster, simply run:

```sh
make tilt-up
```

If you deploy on external cluster, run the command below, pointing `TILT_KUBECONFIG` to your `kubeconfig` file:

```sh
TILT_KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config make tilt-down
```

Now, when you make changes to the code, the metrics adapter binary will be built locally, copied to the Pod, and then executed.

#### Testing

In order to run unit tests run:
```sh
make test
```
In order to run integration and e2e tests run:

```sh
make test-integration
make test-e2e
```

Notice that in order to run both integration tests and e2e is required to configure access to a New Relic account. This can be done either via environment variable directly or by putting required environment variables into `.env` file, which will be read by `Makefile` and they will be used for other commands.

`.env` example content looks like following:
```sh
NEWRELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-XXX
NEWRELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=1
#NEWRELIC_REGION=EU
NEWRELIC_CLUSTER_NAME=my-cluster
```

Also in order to run e2e tests, you will need a working environment available with the `newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter` running. Both installing the `newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter` chart or spinning up the environment with `make tilt-up` are possible options.

It is also possible to run such tests against any cluster you have access to by setting the environment variable `TEST_KUBECONFIG=/your/kube/config/path`.
